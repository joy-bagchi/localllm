So, you’ve learned about the different storage
options that Google Cloud offers, but in what scenarios should you use each one? Ultimately, it’s a combination of the data
type that needs to be stored and the business need. If data is unstructured, then Cloud Storage
is the most appropriate option. You have to decide a storage class: Standard,
Nearline, Coldline, or Archive. Or whether to let the Autoclass feature decide
that for you. If data is structured or semi-structured,
choosing a storage product will depend on whether workloads are transactional or analytical. Transactional workloads stem from online transaction
processing, or OLTP, systems, which are used when fast data inserts and updates are required
to build row-based records. An example of this is point-of-sale transaction
records. Then there are analytical workloads, which
stem from online analytical processing, or OLAP systems, which are used when entire datasets
need to be read. They often require complex queries, for example,
aggregations. An example here would be analyzing sales history
to see trends and aggregated views. After you determine if the workloads are transactional
or analytical, you must determine whether the data will be accessed by using SQL. So, if your data is transactional and you
need to access it by using SQL, then Cloud SQL and Spanner are two options. Cloud SQL works best for local to regional
scalability, and Spanner is best to scale a database globally. If the transactional data will be accessed
without SQL, Firestore might be the best option. Firestore is a transactional NoSQL, document-oriented
database. If you have analytical workloads that require
SQL commands, BigQuery might be the best option. BigQuery, Google’s data warehouse solution,
lets you analyze petabyte-scale datasets. Alternatively, Bigtable provides a scalable
NoSQL solution for analytical workloads. It’s best for real-time, high-throughput
applications that require only millisecond latency.
